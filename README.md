# surfpy

Wave and weather tools written in pure python

*Work in progress*

### Running the Tests

Because of the crappy python 2/3 compatability fo packages, to run this test you must do so at the package level. So to run tests you can use below:

```bash
python -m surfpy.test_forecast
python -m surfpy.test_buoy
```
